Follow the 80/20 Rule 

Learn 20% of the concepts that you'll use 80% of the time. Don't try to learn every JavaScript method before you start building.

Get Your Foundation Right

Before you touch JavaScript, spend a few days understanding HTML and CSS. You need to know:

HTML: text tags (h1, p), divs and spans, forms and inputs, images and links

CSS: selectors (classes, IDs), Flexbox for layouts, media queries for responsive design

Git: repository creation, basic workflow (init, status, add, commit, push)
